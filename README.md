## github-tutorial

Hello! This is the testing repo for 599 where students will submit their test branch ðŸš€

Now that you're here...
Please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the GitHub Repo to your local computer using method of choice (GitHub Desktop, command line etc.)
2. Create a new Branch called "LASTNAME\_FIRSTNAME\_branch"
3. Publish your new Branch and Fork repo - say "yes I want to make this a fork" since you won't have write access to the repo
4. Edit the README.md file and write a brief description that you could use for your 599 project - If you already have one.. Great! Make it better in some way and submit that (add a photo? add in your contact info?)
5. Commit changes
6. Push Changes to remote origin
7. Take a screenshot of your GitHub forked repo with your README and **submit on Canvas to recieve a participation grade**
8. **I am making changes!**
9.
