Project Title: Mapping Park and Greenspace "Value" Across UBC Campus

My 599 project assesses the value of greenspaces at Vancouver campus by mapping accessibility, usability and social equity using geospatial and statistical methods. Leveraging tools like LiDAR, optimized hotspot analysis, Kriging interpolation and weighted overlay analysis, it identifies spatial disparities in greenspace access and uncovers high-value central areas and underserved peripheral zonesâ€”to inform equitable urban planning and enhance inclusivity for marginalized groups.
