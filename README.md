599 project: Thinning perscriptions for Wetzin'kwa community forest

Wetzin'kwa Community Forest (WCF) is a 30,000ha forest tenure co-managed by the Town of Smithers, the Town of Telkwa and the Wetâ€™suwetâ€™en First Nation. Established in 2007, its management is guided by five values: Cultural, Economic, Ecological, Recreational, and Community. 

This project will use LiDAR derived stand models in combination with a multi-objective decision analysis tool to evaluate thinning prescriptions for lodgepole pine stands in WCF. Specifically, it will explore whether LiDAR-based approaches can help design thinning scenarios that balance the five core values outlined in WCFâ€™s Forest Stewardship Plan.
